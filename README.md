# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Model of calcium oscillations due to negative feedback in olfactory cilia.**   
Reidl J, Borowski P, Sensse A, Starke J, Zapotocky M, Eiswirth M. _Biophys J._

**Abstract:**   
We present a mathematical model for calcium oscillations in the cilia of
olfactory sensory neurons. The underlying mechanism is based on direct
negative regulation of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels by calcium/calmodulin
and does not require any autocatalysis such as calcium-induced calcium
release. The model is in quantitative agreement with available experimental
data, both with respect to oscillations and to fast adaptation. We give
predictions for the ranges of parameters in which oscillations should be
observable. Relevance of the model to calcium oscillations in other systems is
discussed.
